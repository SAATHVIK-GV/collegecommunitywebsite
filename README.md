HI I'M SAATHVIK STUDYING B.E- COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING WITH SPECIALISATION IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING AT CHENNAI INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.
I MADE A SMALL PROJECT WITH MY SKILLS(HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) WHICH MY TEACHERS TAUGHT.
THE PROJECT IS A COLLEGE COMMUNITY WEBSITE WHERE STUDENTS CAN BE ON TRACK OF EVENTS HAPPENING IN THEIR COLLEGE, CAN ALSO BE ON TRACK ON LATEST TECHNOLOGIES, CAN GO THROUGH DIFFERENT CARRER PATHS IN THEIR DOMAIN.
I'VE ALSO ADDED OPPORTUNITIES SECTION, WHERE INTERBNSHIP OPPURTUNITIES AND TECH EVENTS OPPURTUNITIES WILL BE POSTED.
AS A FIRST YEAR STUDENT I FELT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND AN INTERNSHIP FOR ME. SO WITH THIS I WANTED TO REDUCE PROBLEMS OF MY FRIENDS. I WILL BE VERY HAPPY IS IT IS HELPFUL FOR VERY FEW STUDENTS.
AS I'M JUST GETTING STARTED I MADE SIMPLE WEBSITE. I WANTED TO DEVELOP THIS PROJECT MUCH MORE IN FUTURE AND I COMPLETE LEARNING ALL THE SKILLS RELATED TO WEB DEVELOPMENT.
I HAVE LOT MORE THINGS TO ADD, BUT STILL I WANT TO HEAR IT FROM YOU.IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR EDITS PLEASE MAIL ME AT VIJAYSAATHVIK72@GMAIL.COM
THANK YOU.
