    <h1>Fullstack Web Developer</h1>
    <p>A full-stack developer is a combination of a Front-end developer and a Back-end developer. These two in themselves are full-time jobs and most people make careers out of one of them. So, we will start with the Front-end roadmap and then go to the Back-end roadmap.  </p>

        <h1>Data Scientist</h1>
        <p>So before jumping into the complete Roadmap of Data Science one should have a clear goal in his/her mind that why he/she wants to learn Data Science? Is it for the phrase “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century“? Is it for your college academic projects? or is it for your long-term career? or do you want to switch your career to the data scientist world? So first make a clear goal. Why do you want to learn Data Science? For example, if you want to learn Data Science for your college Academic projects then it’s enough to just learn the beginner things in Data Science. Similarly, if you want to build your long-term career then you should learn professional or advanced things also. You have to cover all the prerequisite things in detail. So it’s on your hand and it’s your decision why you want to learn Data Science.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Domain Knowledge</li>
            <p>Most people thinking that domain knowledge is not important in data science, but it is very important. Let’s take an example: If you want to be a data scientist in the banking sector, and you have much more information about the banking sector like stock trading, know about finance, etc. so this is going to be very beneficial for you and the bank itself will give more preference to these type of applicants more than a normal applicant.</p>
